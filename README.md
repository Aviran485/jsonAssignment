# Assignment: File Operations with Node.js

## Created By:  Aviran Amormin and Natalia Akulov

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates two file manipulation tasks using Node.js. (Task #7 and #8)
The tasks include merging lines from multiple text files and processing user data from a JSON file.

---

## Tasks

### **1. Merging Lines from Multiple Files**
- Reads lines from three input files (`f1.txt`, `f2.txt`, `f3.txt`) and merges them into `result.txt`.
- Merging is done iteratively:
  - 1 line from each file in the first round.
  - 2 lines from each file in the second round, and so on.
- Stops when one of the files runs out of lines.

### **2. Processing JSON User Data**
- Reads a JSON file (`users.json`) containing user information.
- Outputs:
  - `user_count.txt` with the total number of users.
  - `user_names.txt` with the names of all users, one per line.

---

## Contains

1. Input files (`f1.txt`, `f2.txt`, `f3.txt`, and `users.json`).
2. Check the output files:
   - `result.txt` (merged lines).
   - `user_count.txt` (total users).
   - `user_names.txt` (list of user names).
3. task7.js
4. task8.js
